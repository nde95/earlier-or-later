## Description

**Earlier or Later** is a game inspired by [Higher or Lower](https://www.higherlowergame.com/) and [Timeguessr](https://timeguessr.com/), and powered by the **Flickr API**. The idea of the game is the player is presented with two randomly selected images, and they have to make an educated guess is the image on the right was taken **earlier** or **later** than the date given to the player on the image on the right. If the guess made was correct, you earn 100 points. However if you guess incorrectly, _the game is over_. The game supports account creation to store your high score and compete on the leaderboards.
