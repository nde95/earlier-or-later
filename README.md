## Description

**Earlier or Later** is a game that uses the Flickr API to present two images to the player. The objective is to guess whether the image on the left was taken at an earlier or later date than the one on the right. A correct guess earns the player 100 points and the compared image becomes the new active image. The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess. High scores can be stored in an optional player account for leaderboard competition.
